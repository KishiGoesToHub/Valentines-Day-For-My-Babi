                    <p>Everything changed in an instant when I met you my Babi. Life suddenly felt so much brighter with you, I know we started dating online because of our long distance but I hope you dont mind it, please hold on to me tight and wait for me to reach you, having fun with you by playing together online makes my day everyday and motivates me to study and do my best for you to be happy.</p>

                    <h3>Shared Joy</h3>
                    <p>Your smile and laughter always fills my heart with warmth and happiness, the way you encourage me whenever I feel so down, depressed and disappointed in myself makes my heart incredibly attached to you, I just know that you're the one for me and I can't let go of you even if we fight sometimes, but still thats a part of a relationship and I know that it will only help us grow together!</p>

Whenever and wherever I am I know I will always be happy as long as you are around giving me updates, calls and text. The way you support me in everything makes me feel so lucky and blessed by God for making me meet you an angel on earth.</p>
